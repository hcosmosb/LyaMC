# LyaMC

This code perform Monte Carlo simulation of Lya photons in 3D space. 
In this repository, I provide a vanila version, which runs with a simplified setup: uniform HI density, temperature, and velocity.
Interested users are encouraged to modify the code properly to read in custom HI density/temperature/velocity field.
